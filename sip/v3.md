## stremio-addons v3

### Preliminary notes

Some things in the current iteration of stremio-addons are obsolete, such as:

* `.add`-ing addon server objects directly
* `validate`


Other desing considerations:

* must be very transport agnostic, in order to support HTTP/HTTPS, mitigate mixed content policy, use `fetch`; additionally it should be compatible with IPFS
* eliminate selection policy, and instead shift this responsibility to the client
